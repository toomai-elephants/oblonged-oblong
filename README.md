# oblonged-oblong
Code for finding dissections of an oblong into oblongs (rectangles n-by-n+1)

We would like to find a Simple Perfect Oblonged Oblong (SPOO).
Simple: The dissection contains no (non-trivially) dissected rectangle
Perfect: No two oblongs in the dissection have the same size
Oblonged: A dissection into oblongs
Oblong: A rectangle of dimensions n by n+1, for n a positive integer

We do not believe anyone has yet found these, but conjecture they exist. (If you know of any, let us know!)
